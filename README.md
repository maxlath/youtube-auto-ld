# Youtube Auto LD

Automatically set Youtube video resolution to a low definition. This is a fork of [Auto HD for YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/auto-hd-4k-8k-for-youtube/), keeping only low definition options and defaulting to `medium` (`360p`), so that people wanting to reduce their environmental footprint can just install it and forget about it.

## License
As I couldn't find the original repository, this fork was done from the `.xpi` provided at [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1702548/auto_hd4k8k_for_youtubetm-1.0.4-fx.xpi], but that archive doesn't include a license, so re-licensing here would be weird.
